This app was created in netbeans IDE and is a fully functioning end to end stock management system. This system connects to a mySQl db so a program like Xamp is needed to run the application. This is app also handles multiple different file io read and write types for reporting. This is text based only and contains no UI at present. It is a Java version of the Asset Management website also on my profile. https://github.com/seanjohn85/Asset-Management-WebSite

The server app that needs to run is server.js. 

This can be run by simply typing node server into the terminal on the project directory.

The server will start and log Listening on *3000 to indicate the port no of the server app.

### Running on the client device

Once the server is running, open a web browser and type localhost:3000. This will connect to the Node server application and the server will serve the index.html web page. When the page loads you are good to go and the client and server setup is successful. Repeat this process to open multiple clients as the game needs more than one user.

If you navigate back to your terminal you will see a message indicating a new client has connected.
